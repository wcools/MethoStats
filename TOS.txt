Terms of Service Agreement
**************************

All projects are discussed and agreed upon before the contract starts. 
Any agreement specifies the client's goals and describes the expected service to be provided by MethoStats, the billing, time frame, the ownership and use of the data and results.

An hourly rate is agreed upon. Exceptionally a project fee can be used aswell. Rates will be competitive for experts in the field.
A rough estimate on the required time will be provided but it is noted that the estimate is conditional on an appropriate delivery of the required information in terms of both time and format. Any failure of the client to provide that information/data may result in a renegotiation of the contract and/or additional time.

If changes are made, they are described in writing during the contract to serve as amendements.
In the unlikely event of failing to deliver on behalf of MethoStats, any billing is waived fully or partially.
Intermediate results can never be used and remain the property of MethoStats. If a contract is terminated by the client, the hours already worked are to be paid in full.

Payement in full should be made the latest 30 days after the invoicing date in order to avoid a late fee daily penalty of 1%.
Major projects will be split up in smaller projects that all will be invoiced separatly resulting in a maximum debt of 10000 euro at any time.

Email is used for spontaneous communication and Skype meetings, Hangouts or phone calls can be arranged in advance from 9 to 21h.

Ownership of the work changes at the end when the contract is fulfilled and full payment is made. MethoStats retains the right to use any delivered work, while guaranteeing anonymity when requested, unless otherwise agreed upon before the start of the contract.

Efforst will be made to ensure minimal loss of work in the unlikely event of unforeseen or sudden termination of a project. The progress will be documented and saved in an accessible way and delivered by a third party made responsible on behalf of MethoStats.
